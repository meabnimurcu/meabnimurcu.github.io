## print it yourself zines

I upload zines here in two formats, in pdf: the first is A5 and each page of the pdf is a zine page. This is good for reading on your laptop, an e-reader (although some of the pictures might look a little bit odd in greyscale) or a tablet. The second is a single A4 page, so you can print it out yourself and fold it into an 8 page booklet. Find out how to fold it [here](https://pocketmod.com/howto), or by searching "8 page booklet from one sheet".


## make your own zines

I use a ridiculously, uneccessarily complicated method to make zines, involving the command line and various stages of compilation, and the open-source, pseudo-programming language LaTeX. If you're interested, [this stackexchange answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/463741/how-to-create-template-for-foldable-booklet-requires-rotating-and-reordering-pa) is pretty much what I do, with some modification to page order and additional packages. For drawing pictures, I use Inkscape (again open source). 

I currently do not plan on putting up the draft LaTeX files for these zines but can do if people are interested in them. at some point when I have time I plan on creating a zine master file, essentially like the one linked in the SE answer above but with my basic modifications.
